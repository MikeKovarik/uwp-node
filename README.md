## Installation

Work in progress. Initial proof-of-concept phase is over, the C# runtime component and broke process are nearly finished, now we're rewriting JS side of the library and working on testing.

```
not yet published to npm
```

## In the wild

`uwp-node` is currently being used to rewrite Electron based app [`Anchora`](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/anchora-app) as a UWP (HTML/JS) app.
